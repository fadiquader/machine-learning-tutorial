### Centrality
Centrality can be defined as determining which nodes or in our case people, are important to a particular network. Another way of framing this is, what node or entity is central to the way a network operates. There are many ways in which importance can be calculated in a network and these are known as centrality measures. Some of them are degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality.

Degree centrality is the number of edges connected to a node, it can be thought of as popularity or the exposure to the network.

Closeness centrality measures the average distance between a node and all other nodes in a network. It can be seen as having indirect influence on a network or the point through which information can be disseminated easily through a network.

Betweenness centrality measures how often a node is between the shortest path to any two randomly chosen nodes. In other words, betweenness is a measure of how many times a node acts as a bridge between the shortest path of any two nodes in the network. Betweenness centrality can be seen as conferring informal power on a node in terms of a node being a sort of gatekeeper or broker between parts of the network. Betweenness centrality of a node v can be expressed mathematically as:

Where the denominator is the total number of the shortest paths from nodes s to t and the numerator is the number of those shortest paths that go through node v.

**Eigenvector Centrality**: The centrality of every node is calculated based on the quality of its connections and not just the number of connections as is the case in degree centrality. Eigenvector centrality can be seen as a measure of the extent to which a node is connected to other influential nodes.

### Recommender Systems
Recommender systems are a way through which information is filtered so that the most relevant content are shown to users. Recommender systems seek to predict the preference a user would give to an item or product in light of their past interaction or behaviors on a platform. It is one of the most commercially viable use cases of machine learning as companies from Amazon to Netflix all have a business model that benefits enormously from  showing relevant content to users in order to increase sales or interaction with their platforms.
